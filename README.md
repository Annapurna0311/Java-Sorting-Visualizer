# Java-Sorting-Visualizer

# Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based project that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It provides an interactive and educational way to understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually demonstrating their step-by-step sorting process.
# Attribute 
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project comes with a user-friendly GUI that enables users to interact with the sorting algorithms visually.

2. Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports a variety of sorting algorithms, including but not limited to:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
3. Real-Time Visualization: Users can observe the sorting algorithms in real-time, as the visualizer animates the sorting process step by step.

4. Adjustable Speed: The visualizer allows users to control the speed of the sorting animation, enabling them to slow down or speed up the visualization as per their preference.
# Getting started
Follow the steps below to get the Sorting Visualizer project up and running:

Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Annapurna0311/Java-Sorting-Visualizer.git
Open the Project: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Java to open the project.

Run the Application: Locate the main Java file and run the application. This will launch the Sorting Visualizer GUI.

# SetUp
1. Upon launching the application, you will be presented with the Sorting Visualizer GUI.
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the available options (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc.) using the provided dropdown menu.
3. Adjust the speed of the sorting animation using the speed control feature to suit your preference.
4. Click on the "Visualize" button to start the sorting process. The visualizer will animate the chosen algorithm, displaying each step of the sorting process.
5. Observe the elements being sorted and the changes happening in real-time on the graphical display.
6. Once the sorting is complete, you can try other sorting algorithms or modify the input data to further explore the sorting algorithms.
